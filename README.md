üß† Animal Image Classifier ‚Äî PyTorch V1

This is a simple, educational project that demonstrates how to build a grayscale image classifier using PyTorch. The model classifies synthetic 28x28 images into three classes: cats, dogs, and raccoons.

The idea is to start small and use this to learn basic PyTorch concepts like:
- Tensor operations
- Model building using `nn.Module`
- Training loop (forward, loss, backward, optimizer)
- Accuracy metrics
- Validation and testing

‚úÖ This project was created by [Geeta Kudumula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/geetakudumula) as part of a practical AI learning path.
