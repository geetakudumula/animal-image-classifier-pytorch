🧠 Animal Image Classifier — PyTorch V1

This is a simple, educational project that demonstrates how to build a grayscale image classifier using PyTorch. The model classifies synthetic 28x28 images into three classes: cats, dogs, and raccoons.

The idea is to start small and use this to learn basic PyTorch concepts like:
- Tensor operations
- Model building using `nn.Module`
- Training loop (forward, loss, backward, optimizer)
- Accuracy metrics
- Validation and testing

## 🧠 Why I Built This

As someone with experience in cloud, streaming, and data architecture, I’m expanding into AI by practicing end-to-end model development and inference using different ML frameworks.

## 🚀 What’s Next (V2 Ideas)

- Use real-world datasets like CIFAR-10
- Add image augmentation and transforms
- Save and load the model for inference
- Add torchmetrics and tensorboard logging
- Try deploying using Flask or Streamlit
